* BUG *
 - WHERE: line 118
 - ISSUE:
   In order for the ./PatientDash component to render the patients,
   ./App.js needs to pass the state of all the users to ./PatientDash/DashboardView.js
   which would pass the users to ./PatientDash/PatientView for each patient. There was
   an issue with accessing each user and assigning it dynamically to each row within
   the table. Currently, a work around was implemented in order to showcase what the
   app would look like for demo day. Please note that all the day for each patient
   is currently the same.

FILE: DashboardView.js
OVERVIEW: Dashboard component.

* BUG *
 - WHERE: line 45
 - ISSUE:
   In order for the page to render properly, it needed a refresh. Currently, an html
   work around for it was to have the button refresh when clicked but it would be
   better to have this render using react render methods.

FILE: PatientView.js
OVERVIEW: Contains patient page components.

* BUG *
 - WHERE: line 19
 - ISSUE:
   Similar to the dataflow issue, we could not get the bundle data to flow properly
   so the bundle data is currently static.

* BUG *
 - WHERE: line 164
 - ISSUE:
   The getChartWeekData() render method uses static data and not data from the database
   dynamically. Additionally, there needs to be other render methods to display data
   for different time scales (i.e. month).

* BUG *
 - WHERE: line 234
 - ISSUE:
   All data is currently static in patient page. Additionally, there needs to be a
   modal where the provider add new data.

FILE: Charts.js
OVERVIEW: Component that builds the line chart configuration.
